# DATA ANALYSIS USING SQL
## Employee Attrition, a case study.
### Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition patterns within an organization using SQL queries. The analysis aims to provide insights into various aspects of employee attrition, including demographic factors, job satisfaction, tenure, and other contributing factors.

### Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

### Understand Employee Demographics: Analyze the demographic characteristics of employees who left the organization, including age, gender, education level, and marital status.

### Explore Job Satisfaction: Investigate factors related to job satisfaction and identify employees with low job satisfaction levels.

### Analyze Tenure and Promotions: Examine employee tenure, promotions, and identify those who have never been promoted.

### Identify Attrition Patterns: Explore attrition rates, reasons for employee departure, and factors contributing to high turnover.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis was downloaded from Kaggle.com, it contains the following key elements:

### Employee Information: Contains details about employees, including their age, gender, education level, and marital status,etc.

### Job Satisfaction: Provides insights into employees' job satisfaction levels.

### Tenure and Promotions: Includes data about employees' tenure in the company and their promotion history.

### Reasons for Attrition: Contains information about the reasons why employees left the organization.

## Folder Structure
The project repository has the following structure:
├── data/Dataset for Data analysis using SQL.csv
├── sql script/Dataset for Data analysis using SQL.sql 
├── README.md

## SQL Queries
The analysis is performed using SQL queries, as demonstrated in the Dataset for Data analysis using SQL.sql file. The queries explore various aspects of employee attrition, including demographic analysis, job satisfaction trends, tenure analysis, and attrition patterns.

## Dependencies
To run the SQL queries, you need access to a MySQL database (MYSQL Workbench 80) or any other SQL-compatible database system.
## Results
The analysis results are presented in the form of SQL queries and their corresponding outputs. The findings include insights into demographic patterns, job satisfaction trends, tenure analysis, and reasons for attrition. Included also is a detailed documentation of my insights and the respective queries used in a Microsoft Word format. I know you will find this useful.
## Acknowledgments
We acknowledge the organization for providing the employee attrition dataset, enabling us to conduct this analysis and gain valuable insights.
